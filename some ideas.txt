In actual use, how quickly does the SharedPreferences become too small for all the transactions?



TODO
- show statistics
	- most important is showing who owes who each month
	- monthly tab

	- positive or negative income (monthly)
	- 

*******

important and bigger thing:
- a repeatable transaction
	- similar choice to the shared/personal
		- weekly/monthly/none
	- needs functionality where when the app is launched the app will check dates and check if repeatable transaction deadlines have been passed
		- or maybe it adds transactions to future ? or something



Additional features
- add night mode/themes?
- add language support?
