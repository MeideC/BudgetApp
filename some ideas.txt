In actual use, how quickly does the SharedPreferences become too small for all the transactions?



TODO
- further develop the viewTransaction
	- show more information in general??

*******

important and bigger thing:
- a repeatable transaction
	- similar choice to the shared/personal
		- weekly/monthly/none
	- needs functionality where when the app is launched the app will check dates and check if repeatable transaction deadlines have been passed
		- or maybe it adds transactions to future ? or something



Additional features
- add night mode/themes?
- add language support?


changelog

You can now add additional information about a transaction (a string)
Added base for the repetition transactions (UI side)
View Transaction now shows proper date of the transaction and shows owner's name instead of id
The transaction now keeps track of the owner's name as a string
	- this simplifies viewing transaction information quite a bit
