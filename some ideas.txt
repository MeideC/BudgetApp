In actual use, how quickly does the SharedPreferences become too small for all the transactions?



TODO
*******
- show statistics
	- most important is showing who owes who each month
	- monthly tab

	- how the incomes and payments are distributed between different transaction types

*******
*******

important and bigger thing:
- a repeatable transaction
	- similar choice to the shared/personal
		- weekly/monthly/none
	- needs functionality where when the app is launched the app will check dates and check if repeatable transaction deadlines have been passed
		- or maybe it adds transactions to future ? or something



Additional features
- add night mode/themes?
- add language support?


*********************
UI planning

Menu buttons:
- add transaciton?
- manage repetitive transactions (is now settings) || lacks implementation and graphics etc.
- show history
- show stats


***************************
changelog
