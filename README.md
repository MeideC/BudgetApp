# BudgetApp
Simple Budget application for android using backendless


With this app you can track your payments and incomes and view statistics about your money. You can join a group of users and add shared payments so the app tells users who has paid the most in the group during a certain time period (Some features are still under development).

So far the app supports:
- Registering and logging in as a user
- Creating and adding users to groups
- Creating new payments and incomes
- Browsing existing transactions sorted by month and the visibility (is the transaction a personal or a shared one)
- Viewing some statistics about your group’s budget
